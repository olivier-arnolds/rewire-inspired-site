              <li><strong>7.5</strong> If Eclectik’s insurer does not provide full cover or if the amount paid by the insurer for the damage suffered by the Client is lower than the proven damage suffered the maximum compensation shall be the agreed rate for the project or if a project runs longer than 6 months the compensation shall be a maximum of the project value over the last six months of the agreement.</li>
              <li><strong>7.6</strong> Eclectik does not guarantee uninterrupted or error-free operation of any third-party software provided. Any warranty for software is subject to the terms of the third party’s software license agreement.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-3">8. Termination</h3>
            <ul className="list-none pl-0 mb-6 space-y-2">
              <li><strong>8.1</strong> Either party may terminate the agreement upon written notice if the other party breaches any material obligation under the agreement and fails to cure such breach within 30 days after receiving written notice of the breach.</li>
              <li><strong>8.2</strong> Eclectik may terminate the agreement or suspend services after the second reminder for payment remains unanswered and the Client fails to make payment as required or breaches any license terms.</li>
              <li><strong>8.3</strong> Upon termination, the Client must immediately cease using any licensed software and return or destroy any copies in its possession, unless otherwise agreed.</li>
              <li><strong>8.4</strong> The claims of Eclectik on the Client are immediately due in the following cases:
                <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mt-2 space-y-1">
                  <li>If after the conclusion of the agreement circumstances become known to Eclectik that give Eclectik good reason to fear that the Client will not meet its obligations (including financial obligations);</li>
                  <li>If Eclectik has asked the Client to provide security for compliance when concluding the agreement and this security is not provided or is insufficient, to be determined by Eclectik;</li>
                  <li>In the event of liquidation, bankruptcy or suspension of payment of the Client.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li><strong>8.5</strong> A suspension of the Client within the framework of the agreement is not possible. In the above cases Eclectik is authorized to suspend the further execution of the agreement, or to dissolve or terminate the agreement, all without prejudice to the right of Eclectik to claim damages.</li>
              <li><strong>8.6</strong> If Eclectik is unable to execute or complete the agreement due to circumstances beyond its control, it is entitled to the agreed rates for the work already performed and compensation for expenses already incurred.</li>
              <li><strong>8.7</strong> Failure to pay a single invoice on the due date makes the balance due on all other invoices that have not yet passed the due date immediately due and payable. Furthermore, Eclectik is entitled, without prior notice of default, to suspend the execution of the agreement and/or all other agreements with the Client and to charge the Client for all damage and costs resulting from this. A possible complaint will not give rise to any postponement of payment. Immediate payment can be demanded of what is due in due time.</li>
              <li><strong>8.8</strong> All payments by the Client are first made to reduce the interest and costs due and then to the principal sum. The Client is not authorized to offset the invoice amount.</li>
              <li><strong>8.9</strong> In the event of late payment, statutory commercial interest will be charged.</li>
              <li><strong>8.10</strong> Eclectik may also cancel the agreements made with prospects on behalf of the Client. The Client cannot claim any compensation.</li>
              <li><strong>8.11</strong> In addition to the extrajudicial costs, all legal process and execution costs that Eclectik must incur shall be borne by the defaulting Client. The Client must pay the actual legal and legal costs incurred, even if these exceed the liquidation rate applied by the relevant court. The Client must therefore reimburse the bills of the lawyer and the bailiff, as well as all other possible legal costs.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-3">9. Force Majeure</h3>
            <ul className="list-none pl-0 mb-6 space-y-2">
              <li><strong>9.1</strong> Neither party shall be held liable for any delay or failure to perform its obligations under the agreement due to circumstances beyond its reasonable control, including but not limited to acts of God, war, natural disasters, strikes, or legal restrictions.</li>
              <li><strong>9.2</strong> In the event of force majeure, the affected party shall notify the other party as soon as possible and make reasonable efforts to mitigate the impact of the force majeure event.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-3">10. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution</h3>
            <ul className="list-none pl-0 mb-6 space-y-2">
              <li><strong>10.1</strong> The agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the Dutch laws.</li>
              <li><strong>10.2</strong> All agreements between the parties are subject to Dutch law. All disputes fall under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Dutch competent court in the district where Company has its head office.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-3">11. Miscellaneous</h3>
            <ul className="list-none pl-0 mb-6 space-y-2">
              <li><strong>11.1</strong> Any changes or amendments to the agreement must be made in writing and signed by both parties.</li>
              <li><strong>11.2</strong> If any provision of the agreement is found to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall continue in full force and effect.</li>
              <li><strong>11.3</strong> The Client may not assign or transfer its rights or obligations under the agreement without prior written consent from Eclectik.</li>
